<h2 align="center">Getting Started</h2>
<p align="center">For now you need to download the Github repo and host it yourself, but for the first alpha release we would have something better.<br> Link the css like you do normally and to see the icons got to https://fluently.datinternet.nl/icon for the icon list (that would also be updated later)</p>
